Create legends for maps and other graphics. Thematic maps need to be accompanied by legible legends to be fully comprehensible. This package offers a wide range of legends useful for cartography, some of which may also be useful for other types of graphics. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of `maplegend` from
CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("maplegend")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version of `maplegend` from
GitHub (**dev** branch) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("riatelab/maplegend", ref = "dev")
```


## Example

The main function is `leg()`. Its `type` argument defines the legend type. 
```{r example, fig.width=9, fig.height=4.5, fig.show="hold"}
library(maplegend)
opar <- par(mar = c(1,1,1,1), mfrow = c(1,2))
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1), asp = 1)
leg(type = "prop", val = c(10, 50, 100), pos = "topleft")
leg(type = "choro", val = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50), pos = "bottomleft")
leg(type = "typo", val = c("A", "B", "C"), pos = "top")
leg(type = "symb", val = c("A", "B", "C"), pos = "topright")
leg(type = "prop_line", val = c(5, 50, 100), pos = "bottom", lwd = 20)
leg(type = "grad_line", val = c(1, 4, 10, 15), pos = "bottomright", lwd = c(1, 5, 10))
box()
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(-50,50), asp = 1)
leg(type = "prop", val = c(10, 50, 100), pos = "topleft", horiz = TRUE)
leg(type = "choro", val = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50), pos = "left", horiz = TRUE)
leg(type = "cont", val = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50), pos = "bottomleft", horiz = TRUE)
leg(type = "cont", val = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50), pos = c(75, 25), horiz = FALSE)
box()
```


It is possible to create composed legends with `leg_comp()` and `leg_draw()`.


```{r example2, fig.width=4.5, fig.height=4.5, fig.show="hold"}
opar <- par(mar = c(1,1,1,1))
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0, 1), ylim = c(0, 1), asp = 1)
leg_comp(type = "prop", val = c(10, 50, 100)) |>
  leg_comp(type = "typo", val = c("A", "B", "C")) |>
  leg_draw(pos = "top", bg = "lightblue", fg = "darkblue", frame_border = NA)
box()
par(opar)
```


## Background

This package is mainly intended for the construction of legends in the [`mapsf`](https://riatelab.github.io/mapsf/) package. 
However, it can also be used independently of `mapsf` with `base` plots or even with [`igraph` plots](https://gist.github.com/rCarto/da5a4b0cd982a8c85cb847506fd2f415).
